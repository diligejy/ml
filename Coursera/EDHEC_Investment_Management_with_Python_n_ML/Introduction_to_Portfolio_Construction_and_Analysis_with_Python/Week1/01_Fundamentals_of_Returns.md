## 1. From prices to Returns

- $R_t , _{t+1} = {(P_{t+1} - P_t) \over P_t}  $

- $R_t, _{t+1} = {P_{t+1} + D_{t, t+1} \over P_t} - 1 = {P_{t+1} + D{t, t+1} - P_t \over P_t}$

- You almost always want to use the total return,not the price return. So be careful when you download data of a stock market index. 

## 2. Multi Period Returns

- $R_{t, t+2} = (1+ R_{t, t+1})(1+R_{t+1, t+2}) - 1$

Example
- You buy a stock that returns 10% on the first day then returns 3% on the second day
    - (1 + .10) + (1 - .03) - 1 = 0.067 = 6.70%


## 3. Annualizing Returns

- The return over the month is 1%. What is the annualized return?
    - $(1 + 0.01)^{12} - 1 = 12.68\% $
